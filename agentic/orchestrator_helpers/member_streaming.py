"""Member-scoped streaming callback proxy.

When a fireteam member runs inside ``fireteam_deploy_node._run_one``, its
execute_tool_node / execute_plan_node / fireteam_member_think_node calls
resolve the streaming callback via ``streaming_callbacks.get(session_id)``.
That returns the ROOT callback, which fires generic ``TOOL_START`` /
``TOOL_COMPLETE`` / ``THINKING`` events — the frontend routes those as
root-level items, bypassing the FireteamMemberCard panel.

This module defines a thin proxy that, when active, rewrites the on_*
methods so events go out as ``FIRETEAM_TOOL_START`` / ``FIRETEAM_TOOL_COMPLETE``
/ ``FIRETEAM_THINKING`` etc., scoped to the member panel in the UI.

The proxy is activated via a ContextVar that the deploy node sets before
creating each member's task. ``asyncio`` copies ContextVar values at
``create_task`` time, so each member task has its own view.
