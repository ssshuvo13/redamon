- Exploit known CVE vulnerabilities directly against a service using Metasploit Framework (MSF) modules
- Keywords: CVE-XXXX, exploit, RCE, vulnerability, pwn, hack, metasploit
"""

_BRUTE_FORCE_SECTION = """### brute_force_credential_guess
- Password guessing / credential attacks using Hydra against login services (SSH, FTP, MySQL, RDP, SMB, etc.)
- Keywords: brute force, crack password, dictionary attack, wordlist, password spray, guess password, credential attack
"""

_PHISHING_SECTION = """### phishing_social_engineering
- Attack where a target user must execute, open, click, or install something (payload, document, link, one-liner)
- Includes: msfvenom payloads, document-based payloads, web delivery, email delivery, handler setup
- Key distinction: target user runs artifact on THEIR machine (vs cve_exploit which hits a service directly)
- Keywords: payload, reverse shell, msfvenom, payload delivery, phishing, document payload, handler
"""

_DOS_SECTION = """### denial_of_service
- Attacks that DISRUPT service availability rather than gaining access or stealing data
- Includes: DoS modules, flooding, slowloris, resource exhaustion, crash exploits
- Key distinction: goal is DISRUPTION/CRASH/UNAVAILABILITY — no shell, no credentials, no data theft
- Keywords: dos, denial of service, crash, disrupt, availability, slowloris, flood, exhaust, stress test, take down, knock offline, overwhelm
"""

- SQL injection testing against web applications using SQLMap and manual techniques
- Includes: error-based, union-based, blind boolean, blind time-based, out-of-band (OOB/DNS exfiltration)
- Key distinction: injecting SQL into application parameters to extract data or gain access
- Keywords: SQL injection, SQLi, sqlmap, database dump, union select, blind injection, WAF bypass, authentication bypass
"""

_UNCLASSIFIED_SECTION = """### <descriptive_term>-unclassified
- ANY exploitation request that does NOT clearly fit the enabled attack skills above
- The agent has no specialized workflow for these — it will use available tools generically
- **Key distinction from phishing:** the attacker directly interacts with a SERVICE/APPLICATION, NOT generating a payload for a target user to execute
  - "Test for SSRF on the API" → unclassified (attacker sends crafted input to a web service)
  - "Generate a reverse shell payload" → phishing (attacker creates a file for a target user to execute)
- **Key distinction from sql_injection:** if the request is specifically about SQL injection, use the `sql_injection` skill instead
- You MUST create a short, descriptive snake_case term followed by "-unclassified"
- Format: `<term>-unclassified` where term is 1-4 lowercase words joined by underscores
- Example values: "ssrf-unclassified", "xss-unclassified", "file_upload-unclassified", "directory_traversal-unclassified"
- Keywords: XSS, cross-site scripting, directory traversal, path traversal, SSRF, file upload, command injection, LFI, RFI, deserialization, XXE, privilege escalation
- Example requests:
  - "Test for SSRF on the API" -> "ssrf-unclassified"
  - "Try to upload a web shell" -> "file_upload-unclassified"
  - "Test for XSS on the login page" -> "xss-unclassified"

### exploitation
- Active exploitation of vulnerabilities
- Brute force / credential attacks
- Generating payloads, reverse shells, or delivery mechanisms for target user execution
- Setting up handlers, listeners, or delivery servers
- Any request that involves gaining unauthorized access
- Example requests:

  - "Pwn the target"

- `required_phase` determines if this is reconnaissance ("informational") or active attack ("exploitation")
- `attack_path_type` MUST always be set — it identifies which agent skill workflow to use, regardless of phase
- For general recon with no specific attack technique, use "recon-unclassified"
- For unclassified attack techniques, use a descriptive term followed by "-unclassified" (e.g., "xss-unclassified")
- `detected_service` should only be set for brute_force_credential_guess, null otherwise
- `confidence` should be 0.9+ if the intent is very clear, 0.6-0.8 if somewhat ambiguous
- `target_host`, `target_port`, `target_cves` are best-effort extraction — null/empty if not mentioned""")
