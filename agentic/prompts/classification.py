- ANY exploitation request that does NOT clearly fit the enabled attack skills above
- The agent has no specialized workflow for these — it will use available tools generically
- **Key distinction from phishing:** the attacker directly interacts with a SERVICE/APPLICATION, NOT generating a payload for a human victim
  - "Try SQL injection on the web app" → unclassified (attacker sends crafted input to a web service)
  - "Generate a reverse shell payload" → phishing (attacker creates a file for a victim to execute)
- You MUST create a short, descriptive snake_case term followed by "-unclassified"
- Format: `<term>-unclassified` where term is 1-4 lowercase words joined by underscores
- Example values: "sql_injection-unclassified", "ssrf-unclassified", "xss-unclassified", "file_upload-unclassified", "directory_traversal-unclassified"
- Keywords: SQL injection, XSS, cross-site scripting, directory traversal, path traversal, SSRF, file upload, command injection, LFI, RFI, deserialization, XXE, privilege escalation
- Example requests:
  - "Try SQL injection on the web app" -> "sql_injection-unclassified"
  - "Test for SSRF on the API" -> "ssrf-unclassified"
  - "Try to upload a web shell" -> "file_upload-unclassified"

- Active exploitation of vulnerabilities
- Brute force / credential attacks
- Generating payloads, malicious files, reverse shells, or backdoors for victim execution
